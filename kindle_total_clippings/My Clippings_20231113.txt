Why does the bank want higher deposits? Because your money is lent out to others – loans earn the bank anywhere between 10 per cent to 18 per cent, while you get a 4 per cent interest on your savings deposit. The difference between what you get and what the bank earns, minus costs, is the bank’s profit.

Shortlist three or four policies that you like in terms of low prices for your age, cover and tenure, and then start looking at the claims experience. This is not so easy to find. A claims experience of over 95 per cent is fine. This means that the company pays 95 per cent of the claims filed. Do a simple google search on this metric to see which firms show up.

Debt is just an umbrella term for all financial products that are based on borrowing. Equity is ownership of a business and the risk that it brings, either directly (through stocks) or indirectly (through mutual funds). Real assets are those that can be physically seen. Debt and equity are called ‘financial assets’, while real estate and gold are called ‘real assets’. Each of these three buckets has certain features and you need parts of all three in your money box.

To understand equity, we need to understand how a business works. There are two ways by which entrepreneurs can fund their businesses – debt and equity. Imagine that your friend makes the best biryani in Delhi. But she makes it at home for her friends and family. You and others egg her on and she sets up a small home takeaway service. The biryani delivery is a runaway hit. She wants to expand the business – she wants to set up five kitchens in different parts of the city and grow the business fivefold. Now she will have to rent the kitchen premises, hire more people and get more equipment. The cost of this expansion is Rs 30 lakhs. She can borrow the money from a bank, but you and a few more friends decide to stake her out. Four of you contribute Rs 5 lakhs each; she puts in another Rs 10 lakhs. On a pro-rata basis, each of you now owns a slice of the biryani business; she owns twice your one-sixth share. You four have one share each and she has two shares in the business. The business does well. At the end of the year the profit is Rs 12 lakhs. Each ‘share’ in the business makes a profit of Rs 2 lakhs. You decide not to take home the profit, but invest it further in the business. From the Rs 12-lakh profit, she opens even more kitchens. The profit in year two is Rs 20 lakhs. One friend is going abroad and wants to sell his ‘share’. He had paid Rs 5 lakhs for his share and is now willing to sell. Will he sell for Rs 5 lakhs or more? More, right? Because the company is profitable and has gathered value; the price at which he will sell will be more than Rs 5 lakhs. If you want to buy his share, you will look at what potential this biryani business has to earn profits and then you will make an offer. You will do the maths and may be willing to pay Rs 8 lakhs. This Rs 3 lakhs he has made is his ‘profit’. He had invested Rs 5 lakhs and he is selling his share at Rs 8 lakhs. This is what ‘capital appreciation’ means in the language of the stock market.

The Sensex and Nifty50 are broad market indices and are also called large-cap indices. You must have heard the term ‘market cap’ or ‘market capitalization’ – this is just the number of shares of the company multiplied by the price. If the firm has 100 shares in the market and they currently sell at Rs 50 per share, then the market cap is Rs 5,000.

Why do I say that stocks are the best route to get inflation-adjusted returns? Or returns that are higher than the rise in prices. Remember that FD returns usually get you returns that destroy your purchasing power. What is it about stock prices that make it inflation-adjusted? Again, go back to basics. As inflation rises in the system – the input costs for the firms go up – they are passed on to the consumers in the form of higher final prices. The ‘margins’ or the profits of the firm, therefore, get protection from the effect of input price inflation.

The bonds that a liquid fund buys are short-maturity bonds, or bonds that will mature within an average of three months. ‘Average maturity’ will be a term you will come across when you go to buy a debt fund. All that it means is that the average holding period of all the bonds is about three months. Some bonds may be maturing tomorrow, some in a week, some in two months and some may mature in four months. The average of all these different maturing dates is three months.

Imagine there are 100 investors and each has put in Rs 1,000 in an equity mutual fund. Each bought a unit for the price of Rs 10; therefore, each investor holds 100 units. A sum of Rs 1 lakh is invested by the mutual fund in different stocks. A year later the value of the portfolio is Rs 1.5 lakhs, giving a profit of Rs 50,000. This will be shared equally by the units, but before that costs will be removed. If the cost is Rs 10,000, the profit that goes to the unit holders is Rs 40,000. This gets reflected in the NAV that goes from Rs 10 to Rs 14. Your 100 units are now worth Rs 1,400. Multiply the NAV with the number of units you hold to get the value of your mutual fund holding per scheme.

In its simplest form, a market-linked investment product carries three kinds of costs. One, the cost to enter the product, also called a front load. If you invest Rs 100, and Rs 2 from that is cut out so that Rs 98 is invested, the Rs 2 is called a load. A load is part of the price of the product, or is embedded in the price – it is an invisible charge because it is not usually disclosed. Mutual funds have zero loads and are an extremely investor-friendly product. The question to ask when buying a market-linked investment product is: How much of the money I invest goes to work? Two, an ongoing cost or the annual fees that you need to pay to have experts manage your money. To take care of the running costs and profits of investment managers each year, some fees are deducted from your money. The cost to you of handing over your money to professionals is captured in a number called the ‘expense ratio’. This is the fees that a mutual fund charges investors for its costs and the profits it makes.

Cash flow cell You need three bank accounts when you are starting out. As you get more used to the cash flow system, you can use just two. Your salary account is your income account where all inflows drop. The Spend-it account can be a joint account with your partner or parent or child – whoever shares the routine household expenses with you. It is a good idea for both partners to contribute to running of the house. It is usual for a woman to use her salary to run the house and the man his to build the assets. Unfortunately, in a divorce situation, the law awards assets to the person that paid for them. So share the routine expenses and build assets in both names.

At age forty, you should have three times your annual income as your retirement corpus already. If you earn Rs 15 lakhs a year at age forty, you should have Rs 45 lakhs in your retirement corpus. At fifty, you should have six times your annual income. If you have an annual income of Rs 40 lakhs at age fifty, you should already have Rs 2.4 crores in your corpus. At age sixty, or at retirement, you should have eight times your annual salary. Earning a crore at sixty, you must have Rs 8 crores as corpus. The Fidelity numbers assume a US scenario with social security and other benefits, but the multipliers roughly work out to a rule of thumb for India as well.

Next, count all the balances in your provident fund, your public provident fund, your fixed deposits, gold, any real estate other than the home you live in. Include the value of your mutual funds if any; find out what the value of the endowment or money-back policies are and count those in as well. The more you have already, the less you need to target. Do not underestimate the power of order in your money box. Two, remember that you are already saving 24 per cent of your basic income through your employees’ provident fund (EPF) deductions. You contribute 12 per cent and your employer matches that. By age thirty, most people have begun to do at least their tax-saving investments, if not a bit more. Count that in when you think about the 30 per cent or 40 per cent number we read about in the ‘Save your age’ section above.

Write the idea of each scene or sequence on a single card, and a few brief words of description (no more than five or six) to aid you while you’re writing. You need fourteen cards per thirty pages of screenplay.

Descriptions of characters or places should not be longer than a few lines. And descriptive paragraphs, describing the action, should be no longer than four sentences. That’s not a hard-and-fast rule, it’s only a suggestion. The more “white space” you can have on the page, the better it looks. Line 3—Double-space; the general term Moving specifies a change in camera focus. (It is not a camera instruction. It is a “suggestion.”) Line 4—Double-space; there is a change from outside the jeep to inside. We are focusing on the character, Joe Chaco. He is the subject of the shot. Line 5—New characters introduced are always capitalized. Line 6—The character speaking is always capitalized and placed in the center of the page. Line 7—Stage directions for the actor are written in parentheses under the name of the character speaking, always single-spaced. Don’t abuse parentheses; use only when necessary. Line 8—Dialogue is placed in the center of the page, so the character speaking forms a block in the center of the page, surrounded by description from margin to margin. Several lines of dialogue are always single-spaced. Line 9—Stage directions also include what characters do within the scene—any kind of reactions, silent and otherwise. Line 10—Sound effects, or music effects, are always capitalized. This is an old tradition in the moviemaking process. Usually the last step in the filmmaking process is to give the film to the music and effects editors. The film is “locked”—that is, the picture track cannot be changed or altered.

Line 11—If you choose to indicate the end of a scene you may write “CUT TO:” or “DISSOLVE TO:” (a dissolve is two images overlapping each other; one fades out as the other fades in) or “FADE OUT,” used to indicate a fade to black. It should be noted that optical effects like “fades” or “dissolves” are usually a film decision, made by the director or film editor. It is not the writer’s decision, but if it makes you feel more comfortable in terms of how to read the screenplay, do it.

Remember that dialogue is a function of character. Let’s review the purpose of dialogue. Dialogue: moves the story forward; reveals information about the characters—after all, they do have a history; communicates necessary facts and information to the reader; establishes character relationships, making them real, natural, and spontaneous; gives your characters depth, insight, and purpose; reveals the conflicts of the story and characters; reveals the emotional states of your characters; and comments on the action.

Which brings us to the subject of the rewrite. You know the adage “Writing is rewriting”; well, it’s true. The draft you send out into the marketplace is really three different drafts: the first “words on paper” draft; what I call “the mechanical draft”; and the third draft, “the polish.” This is the draft where most of the script gets written. After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it aside for a week. Then go back and reread the material from beginning to end in one sitting. Be sure to lock up all pens, pencils, and paper and to keep the computer turned off. You don’t want to take any notes as you read. You just want to read. When you go through the first “words on paper” draft, you’ll find yourself on the roller coaster of emotion. Some parts you think are terrible: The writing is poor, the story is all told in dialogue, the descriptions are too long, too thick, too cluttered, and what you’re reading feels weak, awkward, too direct, and just doesn’t work.

The number one thing a good logline must have, the single most important element, is: irony. My good friend and former writing partner, the funny and fast-typing Colby Carr, pointed this out to me one time and he's IOO% correct. And that goes for whether it's a comedy or a drama.

In order to better create a good "What is it?" the spec screenwriter must be able to tell a good one-line or logline — a one- or two-sentence grabber that tells us everything. It must satisfy four basic elements to be effective: 1. Irony. It must be in some way ironic and emotionally involving — a dramatic situation that is like an itch you have to scratch. 2. A compelling mental picture. It must bloom in your mind when you hear it. A whole movie must be implied, often including a time frame. 3. Audience and cost. It must demarcate the tone, the target audience, and the sense of cost, so buyers will know if it can make a profit. 4. A killer title. The one-two punch of a good logline must include a great title, one that "says what it is" and does so in a clever way.

The 10 types of movies I have categorized here are: Monster in. the House — Of which Jaws, Tremors, Alien, The Exorcist, Fatal Attraction, and Panic Room are examples. Golden Fleece — This is the category of movie best exemplified by Star Wars; The Wizard of Oz; Planes, Trains and Automobiles; Back To The Future; and most "heist movies." Out of the Bottle — This incorporates films like Liar, Liar; Bruce Almighty; Love Potion ; Freaky Friday; Flubber; and even my own little kid hit from Disney, Blank Check. Dude with a Problem — This is a genre that ranges in style, tone, and emotional substance from Breakdown and Die Hard to Titanic and Schindler's List. Rites Of Passage — Every change-of-life story from IO to Ordinary People to Days of Wine and Roses makes this category. Buddy Love — This genre is about more than the buddy movie dynamic as seen in cop buddy pictures, Dumb & Dumber, and Rain Man — but also every love story ever made! Whydunit — Who cares who, it's why that counts. Includes Chinatown, China Syndrome, JFK, and The Insider. The Fool Triumphant — One of the oldest story types, this category includes Being There, Forrest Gump, Dave, The Jerk, Amadeus, and the work of silent clowns like Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. Institutionalized. —Just like it sounds, this is about groups: Animal House, M*A*S*H, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and "family" sagas such as American Beauty and The Godfather. Superhero — This isn't just about the obvious tales you'd think of, like Superman and Batman, but also includes Dracula, Frankenstein, even Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind. Are you thoroughly confused? Do you doubt my sanity when I tell you that Schindler's List and Die Hard are in the same category?

I like to think of movies as divided into three separate worlds. Most people call these three acts, I call em thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The first IO pages and the rest of Act One is the movie's thesis; it's where we see the world as it is before the adventure starts. It is a full-fledged documentation of the hero's world labeled "before." There is a calm before the storm in this world, and especially in the set-up. If events that follow did not occur, it would pretty much stay this way. But there is a sense in the set-up that a storm's about to hit, because for things to stay as they are... is death. Things must change.

FUN AND GAMES (30-55) The fun and games section is that part of the screenplay that, I like to say, provides: The promise of the premise. It is the core and essence of the movie's poster. It is where most of the trailer moments of a movie are found. And it's where we aren't as concerned with the forward progress of the story — the stakes won't be raised until the midpoint — as we are concerned with having "fun."

The midpoint has a matching beat in the BS? on Page 75 called "All Is Lost," which is described as "false defeat." These two points are a set. It's because the two beats are the inverse of each other. The rule is: It's never as good as it seems to be at the midpoint and it's never as bad as it seems at the All Is Lost point. Or vice versa!

But here's my little trade secret that I put into every All Is Lost moment just for added spice, and it's something that many hit movies have. I call it the whiff of death. I started to notice how many great movies use the All Is Lost point to kill someone. Obi Wan in Star Wars is the best example — what will Luke do now?? All Is Lost is the place where mentors go to die, presumably so their students can discover "they had it in them all along." The mentor's death clears the way to prove that.

DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL (75-85) So now you're in the middle of a death moment at the All Is Lost point, but how does your character experiencing this moment feel about it? This question is answered in a section of the screenplay I call Dark Night of the Soul. It can last five seconds or five minutes. But it's in there. And it's vital. It's the point, as the name suggests, that is the darkness right before the dawn. It is the point just before the hero reaches way, deep down and pulls out that last, best idea that will save himself and everyone around him. But at the moment, that idea is nowhere in sight.

MISS CONGENIALITY___________________ (A $IOO million hit comedy in 15 beats) Opening Image: Miss Congeniality opens on Sandra Bullock's character in flashback as a playground tough. The image is: Sandra surrounded by boys. Sandra is a tomboy and she's beating them up. Sandra has issues. When we CUT TO: The Present, Sandra is still surrounded by boys, still a tomboy, but she's an FBI agent, at home in the world of Men — kind of. Theme Stated: When Sandra declares that she doesn't need to worry about being "feminine" because she's an FBI agent, that statement is the movie's theme. But is this statement true? We shall see. The movie will explore the subject of femininity. It is an essay on the pros and cons of being tough and a woman. Can you be both? That's what this movie is about. The Set-up: By page IO we have met everyone who will appear in the A story of the movie and "set up" the world. We've met Benjamin Bratt, whom Sandra kind of likes. But she is off his radar; he likes "classy" girls that Sandra scoffs at. We also meet Sandra's boss (Ernie Hudson) and the world of the FBI. It's tough, a boy's club, and Sandra fits right in. And though she is a wheezing nerd with bad hair and no social life, she seems happy — a classic set-up, with a sense a storm's about to hit. It can't stay like this. Stasis equals death. Catalyst: A classic call to adventure. News comes that there's been a murder threat at the American Miss Pageant. We also meet those in charge of the pageant, Candice Bergen and her son, and their "Bert Parks," William Shatner and his hairpiece — and a very sporty model it is! To stop the murders, they hatch a plan that calls for a female agent to go undercover as a contestant. After going through a database of every available female FBI agent... they pick Sandra. Debate: But can she pull it off? That is the debate question of this section. It is answered after several funny moments with Sandra's mentor (Michael Caine), who agrees to take on the challenge of turning Sandra into a sexy girl. Break into Two: Sandra strides from her makeover looking hot, hot, hot in her mini-skirt. Even Benjamin is impressed. Then she stumbles. This isn't going to be easy, but Sandra is ready to try. So let the act break and Act Two begin! Fun and Games: Classic promise of the premise, including all those funny trailer moments where a pistol-packing FBI agent is undercover at the American Miss pageant. Sandra's water-glass talent show demonstration ends as she leaps off the stage to nab a suspect, etc. The fish is out of water and the clash leads to jokes. This is why we came to this movie. This is what lured us when we saw the poster. And it's fun! B Story: The love story here is actually between Sandra and the girl contestants. Why? Because the theme of the movie is about femininity and Sandra does not know this world. It is full of funhouse mirror versions of femininity — each contestant has a talent and a quirk and each, to Sandra's surprise, needs and likes her. It is Sandra's interaction with the girls of Girl World that carries the message of the picture and is its heart. And while Sandra also gets to kiss Benjamin by the movie's end, it will be because of the girls that she learns and grows and discovers her feminine side. Midpoint: The fun and games are over as a new threat to the pageant is announced and Sandra's stakes are raised. We have seen all the fun stuff (Sandra and her water glasses), met the suspects, had the joy of watching a tomboy interact with the girls she once thought odd. Now the real trouble starts. Bad Guys Close In: Sandra's doubts about her femininity grow, her conflict with her mentor deepens, and, in this case, actual bad guys move closer, unseen in the shadows of the pageant. Though no one has died, there's a list of suspects. All Is Lost: Told by her boss to stand down, Sandra refuses. She has a lead on a suspect. But her boss delivers an ultimatum: Either quit the case or be fired. Sandra chooses to stay on at the pageant. Thus, she has reached a classic All Is Lost moment: She is worse off than when this movie started! The whiff of death is the death of her identity. Without being "the Girl with the Badge" — who is she? Not even her mentor (Caine) can help, but he does give her a last weapon: a new dress. Dark Night of the Soul: Sandra arrives for the pageant finale and is a total mess. She's lost in the netherworld of being neither FBI agent nor full-fledged woman. What to do? Break into Three: With help from friends she's made in Girl World, Sandra is put back together by the other contestants for the pageant finale. Embraced by what was once foreign to her, and confident that the girls really care, Sandra is revived. By helping Sandra, the girls also help themselves. Finale: The pageant itself. A classic bit of synthesis occurs when Sandra hangs in during the talent portion of her show by using her FBI skills on stage with Benjamin. The two worlds are fused together, answering the question raised in Theme Stated: Yes! She can be both tough and sexy. Sandra now catches the bad guys, Gandice and her son. (Candice's warped view of her own femininity is what caused her to sabotage the pageant.) Sandra has proven herself to be a woman among women. And she's brought the bad guys to justice. Final Image: Miss Congeniality closes with the opposite of the opening image: Sandra is surrounded by women. Sandra is awarded the coveted Miss Congeniality Award by her fellows — quite a change! The Real Happy Ending: $IOO million in domestic B.O. Now that you know that it works, you'll start to see how these beats can apply to your script.

I start with the midpoint. As discussed in the previous chapter, it's an "up" or "down. " Either your hero (or heroes) reach a dizzyingly false victory at page 55 or an equally false and dizzying defeat. In most cases, nailing the midpoint will help guide you — and it is the one decision you must make before you can go on. Most people can nail the break into Act Two. The set-up you've got, and the adventure, or at least the beginning of it, is the movie in your head. But where does it go from there? The midpoint tells you.

+/- AND >< Now that you have your 40 cards up on The Board and you're pretty sure this is how your story goes, you think you're done, but you're not. Here are two really important things you must put on each card and answer to your satisfaction before you can begin writing your screenplay: One is the symbol +/-. The other is the symbol ><. These two symbols should be written in a color pen you have not used and put at the bottom of each card like this:

The other symbol, ><, denotes conflict. To understand what the conflict is, I always like to think of a scene like this: As the lights come up, two people walk into a room from opposite doors, meet in the middle, and begin to struggle past each other to reach the door on the other side. They each enter the scene with a goal and standing in their way is an obstacle. That's conflict.

Are you excited? You should be. But let's just make sure you're set by going over the "Get Ready for Your Deep-Sea Dive" Checklist: 1. You have come up with a great idea. And I mean it's killer! You have a killer title, a KILLER logline, and you've tested it on friends and strangers, and every one of them can't wait to see your movie! 2. You have done your homework on genre. You've figured out what your movie is most like and screened every relevant Hollywood film in the past 20 years. You know what the filmmakers did right, what they did wrong, and more importantly how your movie will be a step forward and be the same thing... only different. And you are convinced you've got something new!! 3. You have figured out the perfect hero to take this journey. This is the character that offers the most conflict in that situation, has the longest way to go emotionally, and is the most demographically pleasing! And you've given your hero a primal goal and a real tad guy who wants to stop him from achieving it!!! 4. Finally you have beat out your movie using the BS2 and have put up all those great scenes on The Board, tried many ideas, themes, and storylines, and have whittled it all down to 40 actual scenes with each scene indicating its emotional change from beginning to end (+/-) and what the conflict is in each (><)!!!! Man, are you ready!! What's stopping you?

The adjunct to Save the Cat says: "A screenwriter must be mindful of getting the audience 'in sync' with the plight of the hero from the very start." To explain what I mean, let's take a look at a movie that definitely does not try to kiss up to the audience: Pulp Fiction. Scene One of Pulp Fiction, basically, is where we meet John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. These are the "heroes."

This is just another example of a great STC trick: When your hero is slightly damaged goods, or even potentially unlikable, make his enemy even more horrible. If you think Travolta is bad, well, look at the Boss. Travolta is a doll compared to that guy. And BINGO! The scales of whom we like versus whom we hate are adjusted to perfect balance.

BLACK VET A.K.A. TOO MUCH MARZIPAN When dealing with conceptual creativity, an offshoot of the Double Mumbo Jumbo rule is a rule I call Black Vet. You often fall in love with certain elements of a movie idea and cling to them. You can't let go. You're Lenny in Of Mice and Men and you're going to squeeze that little rodent to death. And usually when you find yourself in this situation, you must stop. This is when the Black Vet rule allows you to step back from the concept. What is Black Vet? Better to tell you where it came from. In the 1970s. comedian and now actor/writer/director, Albert Brooks, made several film parodies for Saturday Night Live. In one of his best, a piece that tweaked the nose of NBC and the silliness of network programming, Brooks did a hilarious fake promo for several upcoming shows that would be seen that fall on NBC. One of these was called Black Vet. In unctuous "NBC — Be There! " style, it showed a black actor who played a veterinarian cavorting with animals at his clinic. But this guy also has a past in the military. The punchline came when the narrator announced the name of the show and its fake promo line: "Black Vet: He's a veteran and a veterinarian!" Hilarious! But it is also so close to a real show on real TV, so much about the desperation of Hollywood types trying to squeeze 10 pounds of shit into a five-pound bag, that I found it to be brilliant. And I personally never forgot it. "Black Vet" is a joke, and yet you'd be surprised how often we creative folks get caught piling on our great concepts. Like eating too much marzipan, a little goes a long way where ideas are concerned. And more does not always mean better. In my career, my favorite example of this came when I was working with my first writing partner, the quick-witted and entrepreneurial Howard Burkons. We were young and energetic writers with a lot of great ideas — and a lot of bad ones. But Howard and I achieved early success and even earned our WGA cards while working together, a huge step forward for us both. Because we were working in TV, we had a TV series idea, and a good one I thought. Set in the 1950s, it followed the adventures of a blacklisted private eye. We called the show Lefty. Get it? Lefty referred to his political affiliation, but sounded tough and very '5°s- Okay. But Howard and I killed the idea when Howard insisted we also make our hero left-handed. And maybe, Howard suggested, he could also be an ex-boxer, a left-handed ex-boxer! So he's a Communist and an ex-boxer and he's left-handed? I kept asking. And Howard thought that was great. Well... to my mind it was "pick one." To Howard it was a matter of milking the idea for all it was worth. And while I usually trusted Howard's instinct on this stuff— Howard is brilliant when it comes to conceptualizing and a much smarter marketer than I — I just didn't get it. It was Too Much Marzipan. It was Black Vet.

WATCH OUT FOR THAT GLACIER! Very often when bad guys are involved, they will be way off screen somewhere, far away from our hero, and "closing in." Sometimes they close in so slowly, the noose tightens so lackadaisically, you want to yell at the screen: Watch Out for That Glacier! Well, I do anyway. That's how the "danger" is coming toward your hero: s-l-o-w-l-y! One inch per year. That's how unthreatening your supposedly threatening horror is. And if you think this doesn't happen to the big boys as well as you and me, you're wrong. Slow danger happens to good movies all the time.

Keep the Press Out, the rule I learned from Steven Spielberg, was taught to me while we were developing a screenplay Jim Haggin and I had sold to Amblin called Nuclear Family. The premise of this movie is: A family camps out one night on a nuclear dumpsite and wakes up the next day with super powers. Nuclear Family is a wish-fulfillment comedy. Each family member has a need that their super-power quenches: Dad, an ad exec, gets the power to read minds and thus leaps ahead of his ratfink nemesis at work; Mom, a housewife, gets the power of telekinesis and becomes a super Mom who can move objects with her mind; Teen Son becomes The Flash and is suddenly his high school's star halfback; and Teen Daughter, forever behind in her schoolwork, gets a super brain and is now able to ace her SATs. It's a fun, special effects-laden fantasy — but it has a message, too. In the end, each of them gives up their powers. Being "successful" they find is not as important as being a family.

TALKING THE PLOT Another problem found in poorly executed screenplays is "talking the plot," and it's a dead giveaway that the writer is green. Characters will walk into scenes and say, "Well, you're my sister, you should know! " and "This sure isn't like the time I was the star fullback for the N.Y. Giants until my... accident." This kind of dialogue is... (say it with me) bad! And yet I completely understand why it's in there.

The basis of the "Turn, Turn, Turn" rule is: The plot doesn't just move ahead, it spins and intensifies as it goes. It is the difference between velocity (a constant speed) and acceleration (an increasing speed). And the rule is: It's not enough for the plot to go forward, it must go forward faster, and with more complexity, to the climax.

THE EMOTIONAL COLOR WHEEL When they say a good movie is "like a roller-coaster ride," they mean that as an audience member watching the story unfold, your emotions have been wrung out. You've laughed; you've cried; you've been aroused; you've been scared; you've felt regret, anger, frustration, near-miss anxiety and, ultimately, breathtaking triumph.

"Hi how are you I'm fine" tells us just how boring flat dialogue can be and what a waste of space it is. Flat dialogue is the kind that anyone can say. And odds are that if your script is full of lines that are right out of real life, that ring true but ring dull, you're not working hard enough to make the characters come to life. Because odds are that if your dialogue is flat, so are the people speaking it.

Then Mike showed me this simple Bad Dialogue Test: Take a page of your script and cover up the names of the people speaking. Now read the repartee as it goes back and forth between two or more characters. Can you tell who is speaking without seeing the name above the dialogue? The first time I tried it, there in Mike's office at Barry & Enright, I was stunned. Damn it, he was right. I couldn't tell one of my characters from the others, and then and there I figured out something else too: All the characters had MY voice!! In a good script, every character must speak differently. Every character must have a unique way of saying even the most mundane "Hi How are you I'm fine" kind of chat.

Each of these is about a primal need that might be better seen as a biological need, the prime directive.

Ask yourself these questions, the "Is It Broken?" Test: 1. Does my hero lead the action? Is he proactive at every stage of the game and fired up by a desire or a goal? 2. Do my characters "talk the plot"? Am I saying things a novelist would say through my characters instead of letting it be seen in the action of my screenplay? 3. Is the bad guy bad enough? Does he offer my hero the right kind of challenge? Do they both belong in this movie? 4. Does my plot move faster and grow more intense after the midpoint? Is more revealed about the hero and the bad guy as we come in to the Act Three finale? 5. Is my script one-note emotionally? Is it all drama? All comedy? All sadness? All frustration? Does it feel like it needs, but does not offer, emotion breaks? 6. Is my dialogue flat? After doing the Bad Dialogue Test does it seem like everyone talks the same? Can I tell one character from another just by how he or she speaks? 7. Do my minor characters stand out from each other, and are they easy to differentiate by how they look in the mind's eye? Is each unique in speech, look, and manner? 8. Does the hero's journey start as far back as it can go? Am I seeing the entire length of the emotional growth of the hero in this story? 9. Is it primal? Are my characters, at their core, reaching out for a primal desire — to be loved, to survive, to protect family, to exact revenge?

The commit object does not actually store your changes—well, not directly, anyway. Instead, Git stores your changes in a different location in the Git repository and simply records (in the commit) where your changes have been stored.

The Git repository itself is divided into two parts—the first part is called the “index,” and the second part is what we will refer to as the “object database.” When we run git add <filename>, Git makes a copy of the file and puts it in the index. We can think of the index as the “staging area,” wherein we can put things till we are sure we want to commit to them. Now when we run the git commit command, it takes the contents of the staging area and stores those in the object database, also known as Git’s memory bank. To put it another way, the index is a place to temporarily house changes. Typically, you make some changes, add them to the index, and then decide if you are ready to commit—if yes, then you make a commit. Otherwise, you can continue making changes, add more changes to the staging area, and then when you feel you are in a good place, commit.

We can divide the stocks in the market into three buckets based on their market cap. Market cap is just the number of stocks multiplied by the market price to give an indication of the size of the company rather than using turnover or profit. Large-cap stocks are the first 100 stocks listed on the stock exchanges in India. Mid-cap stocks lie between the 101st stock and the 250th stock. Small-caps are 251st stock onwards in terms of market cap.

Remember that SEBI’s exercise took place when there were already thousands of crores of investor money across categories. Flexi-cap and large- and mid-cap were two such categories. The flexi-cap category allows the fund manager to invest anywhere in the market across market-caps, the only restriction is that 65 per cent of the assets must be in equity. The fund manager can move dynamically between large-, mid- and small-cap stocks and this gives huge flexibility to the fund manager to predict the next cap cycle and time it to harvest the best returns for investors. If fund managers were really good at predicting the next winning cycle, this category of funds would have outperformed all the categories in equity, I imagine. But when we look at the evidence, this outperformance is not seen. On an average, the flexi-cap funds remain over-invested in large-caps.

A multi-cap fund is more true to label as it has an investing floor built into the category mandate. The fund manager must invest at least 25 per cent of AUM in each of the three market caps. This typically works out to be 50 per cent in large-caps, 25 per cent in mid-caps and 25 per cent in small-caps. This category does not have enough performance history for us to judge how they have done.

There is a three-year lock-in before you can redeem these funds. A small piece of statistics here—the average ten-year annual return for the ELSS category is almost 15 per cent.

This means that all the bonds in this overnight fund will mature or pay back the principal along with the interest on the next day. We will understand the risk in a bond fund better in Chapter 7, but at the moment what we must know is that the closer to today the maturity of the bond is, the lower is the risk of an interest rate change and the further away from today the maturity is, the higher is the risk of such a change. So, overnight bond funds carry very little risk and give returns that are usually better than a savings deposit.

When interest rates go up, bond prices fall. Think it through—you are a fund manager holding bonds that give a 6 per cent interest, but due to a hike in policy rates, the new bonds are being issued at 8 per cent. You will want to sell the 6 per cent bonds and buy the 8 per cent ones for a higher return. Other fund managers will think the same thoughts and go to market to sell. When there is an excess of supply, the price will fall. The reverse happens when interest rates fall—therefore, interest rates and bond prices are inversely related.

To understand these mutual funds, we need to understand a concept called credit risk. This is the risk of the borrower not giving the due interest and principal back to the lender. When mutual funds buy corporate bond securities, they in effect lend money in return for interest and the promise to pay the principal back. When the government borrows, it does so at the lowest rates of interest because its credit risk is zero, which means that the government (at least in India) will always pay back its lenders. But imagine a high-risk sector like real estate. Why do you think real estate firms float deposits and issue bonds with very high rates of interest? Because their risk of default (not paying back interest and principal) is high. Debt funds that invest in non-government bonds are called corporate bond funds. These are meant for debt fund investors who are seeking a higher return than the categories mentioned above. The investor will have to match their ideal holding period to that of the scheme they choose out of all the ones on offer. These are typically ranked low to moderate on the Risk-o-Meter.

For example, a triple A rating means the highest probability of the bond returning both interest and principal on time. A bond with a rating of D is essentially a junk bond—these will have to offer very high rates of interest to see any buyers in the market. Fund managers who want to play the high-risk, high-return game like to invest in the bonds with lower credit rating. SEBI decided to change the name of the category from credit opportunities to credit risk so that retail investors are better able to understand that the potential for a higher return is accompanied by much higher risk.

Floater funds is a category that invests in bonds with interest tied to a benchmark that can move up or down. The returns will float up when rates in the economy rise and float down when the reverse happens. Seen as a lower risk way of investing in debt funds, it still leaves the investor open to credit risk. Investors must also know how to time the markets to best use this category of funds. My advice: use debt funds on the shorter end of the holding period for needs that are within three to four years. Leave the use of other categories to the debt fund experts or if you are working with a planner, use these for a rise in the overall return on the portfolio.

A popular category is balanced advantage fund, also called the dynamic asset allocation fund. This is a go-anywhere fund where the fund manager can move between debt and equity without any limits on either. The idea is that the fund manager is better able to judge the potentially winning asset class and will move money ahead of a bull run in either to harvest a higher return.

The fund manager, under the umbrella of the fund category and the investment mandate, must aim to give higher than benchmark index returns to investors. See page 131 in Chapter 6 to understand benchmarks. Active funds have the potential to give investors a much better return experience than simple index returns, though with much higher risk.

Think of a room, let’s call it trapped-you room, where a movie is playing. You can enter for a price, but once you enter, you are forced to sit for the entire three hours. No bathroom break. No cell phone break. If you really want to get out, you need to pay half the ticket fee. At the end of three hours, you can get out for free. If you did not like the movie, you have no option but to sit it out, or pay up to get out. The movie might turn out to be super good and you might have memories for a lifetime after watching it. Still, would you enter this room? There is another room, let’s call it your-choice room, in the same building, where there is no cost of entry, no cost of exit, but you need to pay a small fee to stay seated for the three hours every one hour. You can exit anytime you want. If you like the movie, after an hour you can pay and continue to sit. If you don’t, you can get out and not pay for the entire movie. Do you like this option?

Open-ended funds are forever funds that never shut down unless the fund house winds them down due to a variety of reasons such as lack of investor interest. Or, due to regulatory changes, the fund is merged with another or shut down fully. This means that the fund house can create an unlimited number of units over the lifetime of the scheme as more and more investors buy into that scheme. No, the value of the fund does not fall as more units are created—this is not a stock, but a unit that has little bits of shares and bonds of forty to seventy companies. You will understand this better when you read about the NAV on page 124 in Chapter 6. The assets under management of these funds can go on rising as more investors buy the fund, but they are divided into the bundles of stocks and bonds they invest in.

Close-ended funds are those that have a subscription window after which you can only redeem your units at the date on which the scheme ends. These work like FDs or endowment plans without the guarantees, of course. The number of units remains the same over the lifetime of the fund. To give liquidity to investors, the rules make listing of close-ended schemes on a stock exchange mandatory. This means that investors don’t sell units to the fund house (the way they do in an open-ended scheme) but can sell to other investors on the stock market like you do in direct shares. At the close date of the scheme, investors redeem their units to the fund house and get their money back.

Then, in a bid to show higher and higher returns, some fund houses began to lower the credit quality. We know that the higher the riskiness of a bond, the lower the credit rating and the higher the interest rate the bond will have to offer to attract investors.

The industry innovated to bring to market a hybrid between an open-ended and a close-ended product and this was called an interval fund. It invests both in debt and equity, though it stays mostly in the debt space. This fund opens and shuts at periodic intervals and investors have an opportunity to exit.

So, you should always only invest in the direct plan, right? Wrong. Like I said, the highest return might not be the best route for you. This will differ from person to person. A good distributor will give many services starting from portfolio construction (a very complicated exercise for most people), maintaining the portfolio, updating you on changes in funds, managing the contact detail changes, the nominations, the tax work, the rebalancing and many other maintenance jobs that an active portfolio needs. For some super busy people or someone with no knowledge about funds, to go with a regular plan might be a better option than to struggle on your own using the direct option. Investing is not a one-time job, but an active portfolio needs to be looked after on a regular basis. The one situation in which a direct approach is always better is if you are only investing in a broad market index fund with a fill-it–shut-it–forget-it mindset. Then it makes no sense to pay commission to a seller. Or if the bank is doing nothing much in terms of all the services I had listed out, you are better off going direct. But there are distributors I know who add so much value that the higher expense ratio is fully worth it.

Your reason for investing in a fund will determine the next set of choices you are faced with when you set out to buy a mutual fund—whether you want to periodically milk the portfolio, target a certain amount in the future, or just let the tree become an orchard. You have to choose between a growth plan and an income distribution with capital withdrawal plan or IDCW (called dividend plan earlier).

A growth plan allows the money invested to keep growing. The number of units remains the same (unless you buy more units, of course), but the net asset value (NAV) keeps growing over time in a well-performing fund. Read about NAV on page 124, Chapter 6. The NAV grows as the stocks and bonds bought by the mutual fund grow in value. If you do not redeem any units, then the value of your investment continues to grow over time because the number of units multiplied by NAV is the value of your investment, which grows as the NAV rises. For example, if you bought 10,000 units of a scheme at NAV of Rs 50, your invested amount is Rs 5 lakh and if the NAV grows to Rs 100, your money grows to Rs 10 lakh (Rs 100 × 10,000 units).

The income distribution and capital withdrawal (IDCW) option allows you to receive a mix of interest, dividend and profit at intervals that the mutual fund fixes. Quickly recall here that savings become investments when they are put in debt, equity and real assets. These assets can throw off income in the form of interest, dividend and rent. The assets also throw off profit which is called capital gain. This terminology is important, as we will see in Chapter 8 on taxation. In an IDCW option, the mutual fund will periodically dip into the gains and hand it out to you.

In the case of the Franklin fund, Rs 5 lakh invested at Rs 10 NAV is now at Rs 3.4 crore in the growth option, but is worth Rs 18.9 lakh. Rs 3.2 crore has been distributed out to this investor over the lifetime of this fund as dividend or distributed income! Why do funds not distribute all of the gain? I would imagine, to keep the capital ahead of inflation would be just one easy explanation.

Three kinds of IDCW There are three options to choose from on the income-distribution road. Overall, this set of options is not a good idea because of the tax disadvantage that dividends have over a short- or long-term capital gain route. (Read page 178 in Chapter 8.) Tax rules can change but we must still learn about them so that we are not taken by surprise when faced with the IDCW choices at the point of buying the funds.

The third variant is the transfer option of the IDCW. The gain handed out under the IDCW option is parked in another fund so that the investor can use it at a later date. The logic of this option is like this: suppose you have a defined need of money in two years and you want to park some of the profits from your equity funds over these two years towards a part of that goal. Then you might choose the transfer option of the IDCW and ask the fund to park the money in an ultra-short-term debt fund or a money market fund. If you forgot what these are, go back to page 58 in Chapter 4 and just take another look.

There is another option to take home your regular income and profits, and transfer the money for a more liquid product—which we will meet soon—called a systematic withdrawal plan. We will read about this in Chapter 8 on taxation. The IDCW option has yet more choice in the form of daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly payouts.

This is done by using a systematic transfer plan (STP) that collects the lump sum in a low-risk debt scheme and at periodic intervals (decided by you) funds an equity scheme. If uncle had invested that Rs 7 lakh in end-March 2020, by May this money would have been worth Rs 5 lakh. He sold off in disgust and took home Rs 2 lakh of loss. Had he held on till the end of the year, he would have recovered the money and ended the twelve-month period up by Rs 50,000. But had he staggered the investment into Rs 58,000 a month over twelve months, he would have been sitting on Rs 8.3 lakh at the end of the year. You can use this facility by first choosing the equity fund you want to invest in and then from the same fund house, choose a liquid fund to park your lump sum in. Remember to choose a growth option, with low expense ratio with no exit load. Then set up the transfer choosing the amount you want to invest every month from the liquid to the equity. When I set up my first STP many years back, I make a rookie error of choosing a liquid fund of one fund house but an equity fund of another! The same fund house will allow a switch from one scheme to another and this facility is not there between two different fund houses (it should be, but that is another policy debate).

With how much can you begin an STP? The industry norm is a minimum corpus of Rs 12,000 that makes for twelve Rs 1,000 STP or six Rs 2,000 transactions. There is no upper limit on how much you can move and over what period of time between two schemes of the same fund house. Most investors use this facility to park their bonus money, large refunds, loans paid back by family or friends, profits from some investment liquidated like the sale of some property or inherited money. You can use the STP to move from equity to debt as well, though this is less used than the reverse. You can book profits from an equity fund if either you are rebalancing or have a goal approaching and you want to start milking the equity fund. These can be transferred into a low-risk liquid or a money market fund (choose the debt fund depending on when you need the money; see Chapter 10 on how to choose schemes). Again, you need to be careful to set this up between the schemes of the same fund house.

The only thing the planner or advisor or you as a do-it-yourself investor needs to be careful about is that the rate of withdrawal should not be larger than the rate of growth of the fund. The SWP sees redemption of units, so over a long enough period of time, the units can go down to zero if the withdrawal rate is higher than the growth of the NAV.

A demat account will cost you an annual fee. You will need to sign up through a depository participant. There will be broker costs to buy and sell mutual fund units—something that you do not pay when you buy directly from the fund house. The setting up of SIPs, STPs and SWPs might be difficult via the demat route. This route is meant for distributors and corporate agents to set up their own platforms that will then offer these services. Each layer that you add between yourself and the mutual fund will eventually end up costing you something, even though it may be free today. The ETF investing requires a demat account and so do some direct bond purchases.

It is very important to get the choices right before you begin the process of investing in mutual funds. Innovation in the industry has resulted in a large number of options that you need to decide on at the point of scheme purchase. You are doing okay if you understand that open-ended funds are usually the best option as it prevents a lock-in; the growth option is better than the income-distribution option; a sensible SWP is a better option, under most conditions, to an income-distribution option; the direct option, instead of a regular one, saves you the ongoing trail commission embedded in the expense ratio; an SIP is a great way to match savings and investment rhythm; and an STP is a good way to turn a lump sum into an SIP.

An expense ratio is a percentage of your assets under management that is deducted by the fund house towards its costs and profits. An AMC sets up the business, hires offices, hires people for fund management, analysts, admin staff, support staff and needs to pay for all these in-house costs. There are costs of hired services such as fees to registrar and transfer agents, custodians, trustees and lawyers. I won’t waste time explaining each of these—they are an internet search away. The purpose is to give you a system to invest and not get caught in minute operational details. The expense ratio also includes the commissions paid to brokers and distributors for selling the funds. With no front loads in the product, the agents selling the funds need to be compensated for the business they bring to the fund house. Their commission is now a part of the expense ratio and is called a trail commission, or commission that trails the product rather than an upfront one. A trail commission works better for all parts of the market as it puts incentives in the right place. This ratio also includes the profits made by the AMC.

The logic of a reducing cost as AUM rises is this: unlike a manufacturing firm of real goods and services, the costs of fund management do not increase as the AUM rises. A carmaker will have to spend more on raw material, parts, assembly lines and staff as the production of cars increases. But a rising AUM will have most of the costs as fixed with ever-rising profit margins. The cost of fund management does not rise as AUM rises therefore we see the cost ceilings going down as the assets under management go up for a scheme.

The other ways the mutual fund earns is through interest on the bonds it holds, through dividend it receives on shares. When the companies issue rights and bonus shares, those get added to the portfolio as well. So, the value of your money in the fund grows as it receives dividend, interest and makes profits. But all of that money does not belong to you—you need to pay for the costs of the mutual fund, that all sit beneath the expense ratio. These costs are deducted every day so that you can see the value of your money, net of costs, every day. Hence, net asset value.

If the expense ratio is 2 per cent, then on a daily basis, 2 per cent divided by 365 is charged to the fund and your asset value adjusts for this. Mutual funds are ‘marked to market’ every day, which means the value of the portfolio is disclosed every day to show the gains and the losses. Of course, long-term equity investors need not track the NAV every day but once in six months to check on how your investments are doing. The NAV is disclosed every day for another reason—investors can sell their holdings and new investors can come in to buy every day that the market is open. Both need a price that reflects the value of the portfolio on that day. Hence the daily NAV.

You must note two things about the NAV. One, when we calculate returns later on in this chapter, what we will get is net returns since the costs of fund management have already been accounted for in the NAV. So, when you compare NAV across time for the same scheme, it is possible to get a handle on the post-cost growth of your money. The same cannot be said of a product like the unit linked insurance plan (ULIP) that has costs such as the mortality cost (what the pure life insurance part costs) outside of the NAV.

What NAV you get when you invest or redeem depends on the time of your order and the money reaching the fund house. Called cut-off time, this deadline determines which day’s NAV you will get when you buy or sell. Other than overnight and liquid funds, if you place the buy order and get the money to the fund house before 3 p.m. you get that day’s NAV. If your order or money reaches the fund house post this cut off time, you will get the NAV of the next working day. For a sale order placed before 3 p.m., you get the same day’s NAV; after 3 p.m., you get the next day’s NAV.

If the NAV moves from Rs 10 to Rs 50 over a period of three years, then the return has been 400 per cent over the period. On an annual basis it has been 71 per cent return. But where does the return come from? It comes from the underlying portfolio of stocks, bonds, gold and combinations of these that the mutual fund holds. A return is earned in three ways—interest, dividend and profit. Interest on the bonds the portfolio holds. Dividend on the stocks it holds. Profit will come from the gains on prices on stocks, bonds and gold held in the portfolio. How we count return and then what metrics we use become important as we get ready to start choosing mutual fund schemes. We will see in Chapter 12 why the scheme that gave the highest return last year may not be the best for you. But first we need to understand the various measures of return. In the example above, the 400 per cent return certainly looks better than the 71 per cent return, but both are giving you the same return, except in the first case you took a point-to-point return and disregarded the number of years in the middle. This is usually how endowment plans are sold—your Rs 1 lakh becomes Rs 5 lakh. They omit to tell you that this conversion happens over a twenty-year period if you stay in the product. The second measure, also called a compounded annual growth rate or CAGR, is a much better measure for it considers the number of years it took your Rs 10 to turn to Rs 50. The CAGR for the endowment plan is just 8.4 per cent. Using point-to-point returns is also how we evaluate our real estate investments. I’ve heard this said so often: ‘My Rs 30 lakh property became worth Rs 2 crore—such a great return!’ What they do not say is that this journey happened over a thirty-year period, giving a CAGR of 6.5 per cent. Did you know that the CAGR on the Sensex over thirty years has been 14.5 per cent?

The way that mutual fund returns are most often shown is through trailing returns. It gives the past CAGR return history over a time period you can define. Most often we see trailing returns over the past one, three, five, seven, ten, fifteen and twenty years. Each day that you look at the trailing returns, they can look different since they are being calculated with the latest NAV over the past period we select. Trailing returns give a good handle on consistency of performance and we will learn how to use these trailing returns to choose schemes in Chapter 10. But trailing returns have a flaw—they hide the true performance of a scheme over various time periods within a year itself. It will hide the volatility, or the sharp up and down movements of the NAV during the year.

But from 1 February 2018, SEBI mandated that the benchmarks are a total return index rather than a price return index (PRI). A PRI only captures the capital gains (profits) of the securities (stocks and bonds) that it tracks. The total return index also counts interest, dividends along with the capital gains. You would have understood that a total return index will be higher than a PRI because it now includes more items of return. Fund houses would use the PRI to make their schemes look better than they actually were. The TRI would typically show returns that were about 1.5 percentage points higher than the PRI. So, a fund giving a three-year return of 11 per cent would outperform a PRI that showed a three-year return at 10 per cent, but not when compared to the TRI that mapped a 11.5 per cent return. Some fund houses were using the TRI even before the SEBI rule, but it needed regulatory action to bring uniformity in the market.

Mutual funds need to buy the license to use the index they want to use. A part of the expense ratio of index funds and ETFs goes to pay these licensing fees. There are four index providers that funds can use. The regulator is now at the brink of regulating the index providers because they can get up to some sharp tricks as well. An update to this book will map those regulations in the future. I think I will need to do new editions regularly given the pace of the innovations in the industry and the regulations by SEBI, so watch out for updated editions along the way.

A peek behind the curtain We are going to let you in on Git’s little secret. When you add (one or more files) to Git’s index, Git doesn’t touch any of the files in your working directory. Instead, it copies the contents of those files to the index. This is an important point because it is crucial to how Git tracks the content of our files. NOTE We alluded to this in the previous pages. So what happens when we commit? Well, as we know, Git takes the contents of the index, tucks those safely into its memory bank, and represents that version with a commit object. This means that now Git has a third copy of your files contents in its object database! There can be up to three copies of any file in your working directory.

Git looks like: you make some edits to one or more files, then add them to the index, and when you are ready, you commit them. Now, as you are going through this workflow, Git is attempting to track the state of your files so it knows which files are part of your working directory, which files have been added to the index, and which files have already been committed to its object store. Throughout, keep in mind that Git is moving copies of your file from the working directory, to the index, to its object database.
