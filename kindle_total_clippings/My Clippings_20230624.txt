Why does the bank want higher deposits? Because your money is lent out to others – loans earn the bank anywhere between 10 per cent to 18 per cent, while you get a 4 per cent interest on your savings deposit. The difference between what you get and what the bank earns, minus costs, is the bank’s profit.

Shortlist three or four policies that you like in terms of low prices for your age, cover and tenure, and then start looking at the claims experience. This is not so easy to find. A claims experience of over 95 per cent is fine. This means that the company pays 95 per cent of the claims filed. Do a simple google search on this metric to see which firms show up.

Debt is just an umbrella term for all financial products that are based on borrowing. Equity is ownership of a business and the risk that it brings, either directly (through stocks) or indirectly (through mutual funds). Real assets are those that can be physically seen. Debt and equity are called ‘financial assets’, while real estate and gold are called ‘real assets’. Each of these three buckets has certain features and you need parts of all three in your money box.

To understand equity, we need to understand how a business works. There are two ways by which entrepreneurs can fund their businesses – debt and equity. Imagine that your friend makes the best biryani in Delhi. But she makes it at home for her friends and family. You and others egg her on and she sets up a small home takeaway service. The biryani delivery is a runaway hit. She wants to expand the business – she wants to set up five kitchens in different parts of the city and grow the business fivefold. Now she will have to rent the kitchen premises, hire more people and get more equipment. The cost of this expansion is Rs 30 lakhs. She can borrow the money from a bank, but you and a few more friends decide to stake her out. Four of you contribute Rs 5 lakhs each; she puts in another Rs 10 lakhs. On a pro-rata basis, each of you now owns a slice of the biryani business; she owns twice your one-sixth share. You four have one share each and she has two shares in the business. The business does well. At the end of the year the profit is Rs 12 lakhs. Each ‘share’ in the business makes a profit of Rs 2 lakhs. You decide not to take home the profit, but invest it further in the business. From the Rs 12-lakh profit, she opens even more kitchens. The profit in year two is Rs 20 lakhs. One friend is going abroad and wants to sell his ‘share’. He had paid Rs 5 lakhs for his share and is now willing to sell. Will he sell for Rs 5 lakhs or more? More, right? Because the company is profitable and has gathered value; the price at which he will sell will be more than Rs 5 lakhs. If you want to buy his share, you will look at what potential this biryani business has to earn profits and then you will make an offer. You will do the maths and may be willing to pay Rs 8 lakhs. This Rs 3 lakhs he has made is his ‘profit’. He had invested Rs 5 lakhs and he is selling his share at Rs 8 lakhs. This is what ‘capital appreciation’ means in the language of the stock market.

The Sensex and Nifty50 are broad market indices and are also called large-cap indices. You must have heard the term ‘market cap’ or ‘market capitalization’ – this is just the number of shares of the company multiplied by the price. If the firm has 100 shares in the market and they currently sell at Rs 50 per share, then the market cap is Rs 5,000.

Why do I say that stocks are the best route to get inflation-adjusted returns? Or returns that are higher than the rise in prices. Remember that FD returns usually get you returns that destroy your purchasing power. What is it about stock prices that make it inflation-adjusted? Again, go back to basics. As inflation rises in the system – the input costs for the firms go up – they are passed on to the consumers in the form of higher final prices. The ‘margins’ or the profits of the firm, therefore, get protection from the effect of input price inflation.

The bonds that a liquid fund buys are short-maturity bonds, or bonds that will mature within an average of three months. ‘Average maturity’ will be a term you will come across when you go to buy a debt fund. All that it means is that the average holding period of all the bonds is about three months. Some bonds may be maturing tomorrow, some in a week, some in two months and some may mature in four months. The average of all these different maturing dates is three months.

Imagine there are 100 investors and each has put in Rs 1,000 in an equity mutual fund. Each bought a unit for the price of Rs 10; therefore, each investor holds 100 units. A sum of Rs 1 lakh is invested by the mutual fund in different stocks. A year later the value of the portfolio is Rs 1.5 lakhs, giving a profit of Rs 50,000. This will be shared equally by the units, but before that costs will be removed. If the cost is Rs 10,000, the profit that goes to the unit holders is Rs 40,000. This gets reflected in the NAV that goes from Rs 10 to Rs 14. Your 100 units are now worth Rs 1,400. Multiply the NAV with the number of units you hold to get the value of your mutual fund holding per scheme.

In its simplest form, a market-linked investment product carries three kinds of costs. One, the cost to enter the product, also called a front load. If you invest Rs 100, and Rs 2 from that is cut out so that Rs 98 is invested, the Rs 2 is called a load. A load is part of the price of the product, or is embedded in the price – it is an invisible charge because it is not usually disclosed. Mutual funds have zero loads and are an extremely investor-friendly product. The question to ask when buying a market-linked investment product is: How much of the money I invest goes to work? Two, an ongoing cost or the annual fees that you need to pay to have experts manage your money. To take care of the running costs and profits of investment managers each year, some fees are deducted from your money. The cost to you of handing over your money to professionals is captured in a number called the ‘expense ratio’. This is the fees that a mutual fund charges investors for its costs and the profits it makes.

Cash flow cell You need three bank accounts when you are starting out. As you get more used to the cash flow system, you can use just two. Your salary account is your income account where all inflows drop. The Spend-it account can be a joint account with your partner or parent or child – whoever shares the routine household expenses with you. It is a good idea for both partners to contribute to running of the house. It is usual for a woman to use her salary to run the house and the man his to build the assets. Unfortunately, in a divorce situation, the law awards assets to the person that paid for them. So share the routine expenses and build assets in both names.

At age forty, you should have three times your annual income as your retirement corpus already. If you earn Rs 15 lakhs a year at age forty, you should have Rs 45 lakhs in your retirement corpus. At fifty, you should have six times your annual income. If you have an annual income of Rs 40 lakhs at age fifty, you should already have Rs 2.4 crores in your corpus. At age sixty, or at retirement, you should have eight times your annual salary. Earning a crore at sixty, you must have Rs 8 crores as corpus. The Fidelity numbers assume a US scenario with social security and other benefits, but the multipliers roughly work out to a rule of thumb for India as well.

Next, count all the balances in your provident fund, your public provident fund, your fixed deposits, gold, any real estate other than the home you live in. Include the value of your mutual funds if any; find out what the value of the endowment or money-back policies are and count those in as well. The more you have already, the less you need to target. Do not underestimate the power of order in your money box. Two, remember that you are already saving 24 per cent of your basic income through your employees’ provident fund (EPF) deductions. You contribute 12 per cent and your employer matches that. By age thirty, most people have begun to do at least their tax-saving investments, if not a bit more. Count that in when you think about the 30 per cent or 40 per cent number we read about in the ‘Save your age’ section above.

Write the idea of each scene or sequence on a single card, and a few brief words of description (no more than five or six) to aid you while you’re writing. You need fourteen cards per thirty pages of screenplay.

Descriptions of characters or places should not be longer than a few lines. And descriptive paragraphs, describing the action, should be no longer than four sentences. That’s not a hard-and-fast rule, it’s only a suggestion. The more “white space” you can have on the page, the better it looks. Line 3—Double-space; the general term Moving specifies a change in camera focus. (It is not a camera instruction. It is a “suggestion.”) Line 4—Double-space; there is a change from outside the jeep to inside. We are focusing on the character, Joe Chaco. He is the subject of the shot. Line 5—New characters introduced are always capitalized. Line 6—The character speaking is always capitalized and placed in the center of the page. Line 7—Stage directions for the actor are written in parentheses under the name of the character speaking, always single-spaced. Don’t abuse parentheses; use only when necessary. Line 8—Dialogue is placed in the center of the page, so the character speaking forms a block in the center of the page, surrounded by description from margin to margin. Several lines of dialogue are always single-spaced. Line 9—Stage directions also include what characters do within the scene—any kind of reactions, silent and otherwise. Line 10—Sound effects, or music effects, are always capitalized. This is an old tradition in the moviemaking process. Usually the last step in the filmmaking process is to give the film to the music and effects editors. The film is “locked”—that is, the picture track cannot be changed or altered.

Line 11—If you choose to indicate the end of a scene you may write “CUT TO:” or “DISSOLVE TO:” (a dissolve is two images overlapping each other; one fades out as the other fades in) or “FADE OUT,” used to indicate a fade to black. It should be noted that optical effects like “fades” or “dissolves” are usually a film decision, made by the director or film editor. It is not the writer’s decision, but if it makes you feel more comfortable in terms of how to read the screenplay, do it.

Remember that dialogue is a function of character. Let’s review the purpose of dialogue. Dialogue: moves the story forward; reveals information about the characters—after all, they do have a history; communicates necessary facts and information to the reader; establishes character relationships, making them real, natural, and spontaneous; gives your characters depth, insight, and purpose; reveals the conflicts of the story and characters; reveals the emotional states of your characters; and comments on the action.

Which brings us to the subject of the rewrite. You know the adage “Writing is rewriting”; well, it’s true. The draft you send out into the marketplace is really three different drafts: the first “words on paper” draft; what I call “the mechanical draft”; and the third draft, “the polish.” This is the draft where most of the script gets written. After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it aside for a week. Then go back and reread the material from beginning to end in one sitting. Be sure to lock up all pens, pencils, and paper and to keep the computer turned off. You don’t want to take any notes as you read. You just want to read. When you go through the first “words on paper” draft, you’ll find yourself on the roller coaster of emotion. Some parts you think are terrible: The writing is poor, the story is all told in dialogue, the descriptions are too long, too thick, too cluttered, and what you’re reading feels weak, awkward, too direct, and just doesn’t work.

The number one thing a good logline must have, the single most important element, is: irony. My good friend and former writing partner, the funny and fast-typing Colby Carr, pointed this out to me one time and he's IOO% correct. And that goes for whether it's a comedy or a drama.

In order to better create a good "What is it?" the spec screenwriter must be able to tell a good one-line or logline — a one- or two-sentence grabber that tells us everything. It must satisfy four basic elements to be effective: 1. Irony. It must be in some way ironic and emotionally involving — a dramatic situation that is like an itch you have to scratch. 2. A compelling mental picture. It must bloom in your mind when you hear it. A whole movie must be implied, often including a time frame. 3. Audience and cost. It must demarcate the tone, the target audience, and the sense of cost, so buyers will know if it can make a profit. 4. A killer title. The one-two punch of a good logline must include a great title, one that "says what it is" and does so in a clever way.

The 10 types of movies I have categorized here are: Monster in. the House — Of which Jaws, Tremors, Alien, The Exorcist, Fatal Attraction, and Panic Room are examples. Golden Fleece — This is the category of movie best exemplified by Star Wars; The Wizard of Oz; Planes, Trains and Automobiles; Back To The Future; and most "heist movies." Out of the Bottle — This incorporates films like Liar, Liar; Bruce Almighty; Love Potion ; Freaky Friday; Flubber; and even my own little kid hit from Disney, Blank Check. Dude with a Problem — This is a genre that ranges in style, tone, and emotional substance from Breakdown and Die Hard to Titanic and Schindler's List. Rites Of Passage — Every change-of-life story from IO to Ordinary People to Days of Wine and Roses makes this category. Buddy Love — This genre is about more than the buddy movie dynamic as seen in cop buddy pictures, Dumb & Dumber, and Rain Man — but also every love story ever made! Whydunit — Who cares who, it's why that counts. Includes Chinatown, China Syndrome, JFK, and The Insider. The Fool Triumphant — One of the oldest story types, this category includes Being There, Forrest Gump, Dave, The Jerk, Amadeus, and the work of silent clowns like Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. Institutionalized. —Just like it sounds, this is about groups: Animal House, M*A*S*H, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and "family" sagas such as American Beauty and The Godfather. Superhero — This isn't just about the obvious tales you'd think of, like Superman and Batman, but also includes Dracula, Frankenstein, even Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind. Are you thoroughly confused? Do you doubt my sanity when I tell you that Schindler's List and Die Hard are in the same category?

I like to think of movies as divided into three separate worlds. Most people call these three acts, I call em thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The first IO pages and the rest of Act One is the movie's thesis; it's where we see the world as it is before the adventure starts. It is a full-fledged documentation of the hero's world labeled "before." There is a calm before the storm in this world, and especially in the set-up. If events that follow did not occur, it would pretty much stay this way. But there is a sense in the set-up that a storm's about to hit, because for things to stay as they are... is death. Things must change.

FUN AND GAMES (30-55) The fun and games section is that part of the screenplay that, I like to say, provides: The promise of the premise. It is the core and essence of the movie's poster. It is where most of the trailer moments of a movie are found. And it's where we aren't as concerned with the forward progress of the story — the stakes won't be raised until the midpoint — as we are concerned with having "fun."

The midpoint has a matching beat in the BS? on Page 75 called "All Is Lost," which is described as "false defeat." These two points are a set. It's because the two beats are the inverse of each other. The rule is: It's never as good as it seems to be at the midpoint and it's never as bad as it seems at the All Is Lost point. Or vice versa!

But here's my little trade secret that I put into every All Is Lost moment just for added spice, and it's something that many hit movies have. I call it the whiff of death. I started to notice how many great movies use the All Is Lost point to kill someone. Obi Wan in Star Wars is the best example — what will Luke do now?? All Is Lost is the place where mentors go to die, presumably so their students can discover "they had it in them all along." The mentor's death clears the way to prove that.

DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL (75-85) So now you're in the middle of a death moment at the All Is Lost point, but how does your character experiencing this moment feel about it? This question is answered in a section of the screenplay I call Dark Night of the Soul. It can last five seconds or five minutes. But it's in there. And it's vital. It's the point, as the name suggests, that is the darkness right before the dawn. It is the point just before the hero reaches way, deep down and pulls out that last, best idea that will save himself and everyone around him. But at the moment, that idea is nowhere in sight.

MISS CONGENIALITY___________________ (A $IOO million hit comedy in 15 beats) Opening Image: Miss Congeniality opens on Sandra Bullock's character in flashback as a playground tough. The image is: Sandra surrounded by boys. Sandra is a tomboy and she's beating them up. Sandra has issues. When we CUT TO: The Present, Sandra is still surrounded by boys, still a tomboy, but she's an FBI agent, at home in the world of Men — kind of. Theme Stated: When Sandra declares that she doesn't need to worry about being "feminine" because she's an FBI agent, that statement is the movie's theme. But is this statement true? We shall see. The movie will explore the subject of femininity. It is an essay on the pros and cons of being tough and a woman. Can you be both? That's what this movie is about. The Set-up: By page IO we have met everyone who will appear in the A story of the movie and "set up" the world. We've met Benjamin Bratt, whom Sandra kind of likes. But she is off his radar; he likes "classy" girls that Sandra scoffs at. We also meet Sandra's boss (Ernie Hudson) and the world of the FBI. It's tough, a boy's club, and Sandra fits right in. And though she is a wheezing nerd with bad hair and no social life, she seems happy — a classic set-up, with a sense a storm's about to hit. It can't stay like this. Stasis equals death. Catalyst: A classic call to adventure. News comes that there's been a murder threat at the American Miss Pageant. We also meet those in charge of the pageant, Candice Bergen and her son, and their "Bert Parks," William Shatner and his hairpiece — and a very sporty model it is! To stop the murders, they hatch a plan that calls for a female agent to go undercover as a contestant. After going through a database of every available female FBI agent... they pick Sandra. Debate: But can she pull it off? That is the debate question of this section. It is answered after several funny moments with Sandra's mentor (Michael Caine), who agrees to take on the challenge of turning Sandra into a sexy girl. Break into Two: Sandra strides from her makeover looking hot, hot, hot in her mini-skirt. Even Benjamin is impressed. Then she stumbles. This isn't going to be easy, but Sandra is ready to try. So let the act break and Act Two begin! Fun and Games: Classic promise of the premise, including all those funny trailer moments where a pistol-packing FBI agent is undercover at the American Miss pageant. Sandra's water-glass talent show demonstration ends as she leaps off the stage to nab a suspect, etc. The fish is out of water and the clash leads to jokes. This is why we came to this movie. This is what lured us when we saw the poster. And it's fun! B Story: The love story here is actually between Sandra and the girl contestants. Why? Because the theme of the movie is about femininity and Sandra does not know this world. It is full of funhouse mirror versions of femininity — each contestant has a talent and a quirk and each, to Sandra's surprise, needs and likes her. It is Sandra's interaction with the girls of Girl World that carries the message of the picture and is its heart. And while Sandra also gets to kiss Benjamin by the movie's end, it will be because of the girls that she learns and grows and discovers her feminine side. Midpoint: The fun and games are over as a new threat to the pageant is announced and Sandra's stakes are raised. We have seen all the fun stuff (Sandra and her water glasses), met the suspects, had the joy of watching a tomboy interact with the girls she once thought odd. Now the real trouble starts. Bad Guys Close In: Sandra's doubts about her femininity grow, her conflict with her mentor deepens, and, in this case, actual bad guys move closer, unseen in the shadows of the pageant. Though no one has died, there's a list of suspects. All Is Lost: Told by her boss to stand down, Sandra refuses. She has a lead on a suspect. But her boss delivers an ultimatum: Either quit the case or be fired. Sandra chooses to stay on at the pageant. Thus, she has reached a classic All Is Lost moment: She is worse off than when this movie started! The whiff of death is the death of her identity. Without being "the Girl with the Badge" — who is she? Not even her mentor (Caine) can help, but he does give her a last weapon: a new dress. Dark Night of the Soul: Sandra arrives for the pageant finale and is a total mess. She's lost in the netherworld of being neither FBI agent nor full-fledged woman. What to do? Break into Three: With help from friends she's made in Girl World, Sandra is put back together by the other contestants for the pageant finale. Embraced by what was once foreign to her, and confident that the girls really care, Sandra is revived. By helping Sandra, the girls also help themselves. Finale: The pageant itself. A classic bit of synthesis occurs when Sandra hangs in during the talent portion of her show by using her FBI skills on stage with Benjamin. The two worlds are fused together, answering the question raised in Theme Stated: Yes! She can be both tough and sexy. Sandra now catches the bad guys, Gandice and her son. (Candice's warped view of her own femininity is what caused her to sabotage the pageant.) Sandra has proven herself to be a woman among women. And she's brought the bad guys to justice. Final Image: Miss Congeniality closes with the opposite of the opening image: Sandra is surrounded by women. Sandra is awarded the coveted Miss Congeniality Award by her fellows — quite a change! The Real Happy Ending: $IOO million in domestic B.O. Now that you know that it works, you'll start to see how these beats can apply to your script.

I start with the midpoint. As discussed in the previous chapter, it's an "up" or "down. " Either your hero (or heroes) reach a dizzyingly false victory at page 55 or an equally false and dizzying defeat. In most cases, nailing the midpoint will help guide you — and it is the one decision you must make before you can go on. Most people can nail the break into Act Two. The set-up you've got, and the adventure, or at least the beginning of it, is the movie in your head. But where does it go from there? The midpoint tells you.

+/- AND >< Now that you have your 40 cards up on The Board and you're pretty sure this is how your story goes, you think you're done, but you're not. Here are two really important things you must put on each card and answer to your satisfaction before you can begin writing your screenplay: One is the symbol +/-. The other is the symbol ><. These two symbols should be written in a color pen you have not used and put at the bottom of each card like this:

The other symbol, ><, denotes conflict. To understand what the conflict is, I always like to think of a scene like this: As the lights come up, two people walk into a room from opposite doors, meet in the middle, and begin to struggle past each other to reach the door on the other side. They each enter the scene with a goal and standing in their way is an obstacle. That's conflict.

The worst thing that can happen in screenwriting is to not finish. Half-written screenplays never sell, that's for sure. And working out The Board in advance is your best guarantee that this won't happen.

Are you excited? You should be. But let's just make sure you're set by going over the "Get Ready for Your Deep-Sea Dive" Checklist: 1. You have come up with a great idea. And I mean it's killer! You have a killer title, a KILLER logline, and you've tested it on friends and strangers, and every one of them can't wait to see your movie! 2. You have done your homework on genre. You've figured out what your movie is most like and screened every relevant Hollywood film in the past 20 years. You know what the filmmakers did right, what they did wrong, and more importantly how your movie will be a step forward and be the same thing... only different. And you are convinced you've got something new!! 3. You have figured out the perfect hero to take this journey. This is the character that offers the most conflict in that situation, has the longest way to go emotionally, and is the most demographically pleasing! And you've given your hero a primal goal and a real tad guy who wants to stop him from achieving it!!! 4. Finally you have beat out your movie using the BS2 and have put up all those great scenes on The Board, tried many ideas, themes, and storylines, and have whittled it all down to 40 actual scenes with each scene indicating its emotional change from beginning to end (+/-) and what the conflict is in each (><)!!!! Man, are you ready!! What's stopping you?

The adjunct to Save the Cat says: "A screenwriter must be mindful of getting the audience 'in sync' with the plight of the hero from the very start." To explain what I mean, let's take a look at a movie that definitely does not try to kiss up to the audience: Pulp Fiction. Scene One of Pulp Fiction, basically, is where we meet John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. These are the "heroes."
