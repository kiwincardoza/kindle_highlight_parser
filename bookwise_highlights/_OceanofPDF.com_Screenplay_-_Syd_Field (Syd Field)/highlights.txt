In this unit of dramatic action, Act I, the screenwriter sets up the story, establishes character, launches the dramatic premise (what the story is about), illustrates the situation (the circumstances surrounding the action), and creates the relationships between the main character and the other characters who inhabit the landscape of his or her world.

You need a subject to embody and dramatize the idea. A subject is defined as an action and a character. An action is what the story is about, and a character is who the story is about.

First, define the dramatic need of your character. What does your character want? What is his/her need? What drives him to the resolution of your story?
- Your Highlight at location 781-782 | Added on Sunday, 21 May 2023 09:26:59

The need of your character gives you a goal, a destination, an ending to your story. How your character achieves or does not achieve that goal becomes the action of your story.

Separate the components of his/her life into two basic categories: interior and exterior. The interior life of your character takes place from birth up until the time your story begins. It is a process that forms character.

The exterior life of your character takes place from the moment your film begins to the conclusion of the story. It is a process that reveals character.

The best way to do this is to separate your characters’ lives into three basic components—their professional life, their personal life, and their private life. These areas of your characters’ lives can be dramatized over the course of the screenplay.

Reading it from this perspective, I saw four things, four essential qualities that seemed to go into the making of good characters: (1), the characters have a strong and defined dramatic need; (2), they have an individual point of view; (3), they personify an attitude; and (4), they go through some kind of change, or transformation.

Determine the ending of your screenplay, then design your opening. The primary rule for the opening is: Does it set your story in motion? Does it establish your main character? Does it state the dramatic premise? Does it set up the situation? Does it establish or set up a problem that your character must confront and overcome? Does it state your character’s need?

One incident, the opening sex/ murder, is called the inciting incident, because it sets the story in motion;it is the first visual representation of the key incident, what the story is about, and draws the main character into the story line.

the great eighteenth-century German philosopher, maintained that the essence of tragedy derives not from one character being right and the other being wrong, or from the conflict of good versus evil, but from a conflict in which both characters are right, and thus the tragedy is one of “right against right,” being carried to its logical conclusion.

The inciting incident always leads us to the key incident, which is the hub of the story line, the engine that powers the story forward. The key incident reveals to us what the story is about.

The first ten pages of your screenplay, as mentioned, establish three specific things. The main character is introduced so we know who the story is about. In Basic Instinct, after the murder, Michael Douglas is brought into the story when he investigates the crime scene. Who committed the murder and why? In American Beauty we know immediately that the story is about Lester Burnham; he is the main character. In Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, we immediately meet Frodo as Gandalf rides into the Shire.

The purpose of the scene is twofold: Either it moves the story forward or it reveals information about the character. If the scene does not satisfy one, or both, of these two elements, then it doesn’t belong in the screenplay.

First create the context of the scene, then determine the content, what happens. What is the purpose of the scene? Why is it there? How does it move the story forward? What happens within the body of the scene? Where has the character just been before he or she enters the scene? What are the emotional forces working on the character during the scene? Do they impact the purpose of the scene?

How do you build your storyline? By using 3 × 5 cards. Take a pack of 3 × 5 cards. Write the idea of each scene or sequence on a single card, and a few brief words of description (no more than five or six) to aid you while you’re writing. You need fourteen cards per thirty pages of screenplay. More than fourteen means you probably have too much material for Act I; less than fourteen means you may be too thin and need to add a few more scenes to fill out the Set-Up.
- Your Highlight at location 3384-3386 | Added on Tuesday, 13 June 2023 17:07:12

I suggest using fourteen cards per approximately thirty pages of screenplay. That means fourteen cards for Act I, fourteen cards for the First Half of Act II, fourteen cards for the Second Half of Act II, and fourteen cards for Act III. Why fourteen? Because it works.

The writer’s job is to write the screenplay and keep the reader turning pages, not to determine how a scene or sequence should be filmed. You don’t have to tell the director and cinematographer and film editor how to do their jobs. Your job is to write the screenplay, to give them enough visual information so they can bring those words on the page into life,

Line 1—Called the slug line, or scene heading it states the general or specific locale. We are outside, EXT., somewhere in the ARIZONA DESERT; the time is DAY.

Line 2—Double-space, then, the action is single-spaced: your description of people, places, or action, from margin to margin. Descriptions of characters or places should not be longer than a few lines. And descriptive paragraphs, describing the action, should be no longer than four sentences. That’s not a hard-and-fast rule, it’s only a suggestion. The more “white space” you can have on the page, the better it looks. Line 3—Double-space; the general term Moving specifies a change in camera focus. (It is not a camera instruction. It is a “suggestion.”) Line 4—Double-space; there is a change from outside the jeep to inside. We are focusing on the character, Joe Chaco. He is the subject of the shot. Line 5—New characters introduced are always capitalized. Line 6—The character speaking is always capitalized and placed in the center of the page. Line 7—Stage directions for the actor are written in parentheses under the name of the character speaking, always single-spaced. Don’t abuse parentheses; use only when necessary. Line 8—Dialogue is placed in the center of the page, so the character speaking forms a block in the center of the page, surrounded by description from margin to margin. Several lines of dialogue are always single-spaced. Line 9—Stage directions also include what characters do within the scene—any kind of reactions, silent and otherwise. Line 10—Sound effects, or music effects, are always capitalized. This is an old tradition in the moviemaking process. Usually the last step in the filmmaking process is to give the film to the music and effects editors. The film is “locked”—that is, the picture track cannot be changed or altered.

Line 11—If you choose to indicate the end of a scene you may write “CUT TO:” or “DISSOLVE TO:” (a dissolve is two images overlapping each other; one fades out as the other fades in) or “FADE OUT,” used to indicate a fade to black. It should be noted that optical effects like “fades” or “dissolves” are usually a film decision, made by the director or film editor. It is not the writer’s decision, but if it makes you feel more comfortable in terms of how to read the screenplay, do it.

Remember that dialogue is a function of character. Let’s review the purpose of dialogue. Dialogue: moves the story forward; reveals information about the characters—after all, they do have a history; communicates necessary facts and information to the reader; establishes character relationships, making them real, natural, and spontaneous; gives your characters depth, insight, and purpose; reveals the conflicts of the story and characters; reveals the emotional states of your characters; and comments on the action.

Which brings us to the subject of the rewrite. You know the adage “Writing is rewriting”; well, it’s true. The draft you send out into the marketplace is really three different drafts: the first “words on paper” draft; what I call “the mechanical draft”; and the third draft, “the polish.” This is the draft where most of the script gets written. After you complete the first “words on paper” draft, put it aside for a week. Then go back and reread the material from beginning to end in one sitting. Be sure to lock up all pens, pencils, and paper and to keep the computer turned off. You don’t want to take any notes as you read. You just want to read. When you go through the first “words on paper” draft, you’ll find yourself on the roller coaster of emotion. Some parts you think are terrible: The writing is poor, the story is all told in dialogue, the descriptions are too long, too thick, too cluttered, and what you’re reading feels weak, awkward, too direct, and just doesn’t work.
